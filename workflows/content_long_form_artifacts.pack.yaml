  Dynamic artifacts pack providing rhetorical patterns, hooks, argument
  structures, and transition techniques for long-form content workflows.
  Content is materialized from Graphiti knowledge graph
  (s1_inspiration_long_form, s1_content_strategy lanes).
  On materialization failure, this static fallback guidance is used instead,
  and a warning is emitted.

  Rhetorical moves:
  - Inversion: state the conventional wisdom, then dismantle it with a single counterexample.
  - Concession-pivot: acknowledge the strongest opposing point, then redirect with new evidence.
  - Escalation: build from a minor observation to a structural claim in three beats.

  Argument structures:
  - Thesis-antithesis-synthesis: present claim, strongest objection, and a resolution that transcends both.
  - Evidence sandwich: lead with data, interpret in the middle, close with implication.
  - Nested conditionals: "If X, then Y — but only if Z holds."

  Opening strategies:
  - Cold open with a specific, surprising fact that reframes the topic.
  - Start with a question the reader thinks they can answer, then show why they can't.
  - Drop into a scene or moment before pulling back to thesis.

  Transition techniques:
  - Bridge sentence: restate the prior section's conclusion as the next section's premise.
  - Temporal pivot: "That was true until..." or "For the last decade... but now..."
  - Contrast cut: juxtapose two frames without explicit connective tissue.

  Engagement signals:
  - Direct address ("You might think...") to create conversational tension.
  - Embedded questions that the next paragraph answers.
  - Callback references to earlier points that reward attentive readers.

  Narrative arcs:
  - Problem-mechanism-implication: what's broken, why it's broken, what it means.
  - Journey structure: where we were, what changed, where we are, what's next.

  - id: reference
