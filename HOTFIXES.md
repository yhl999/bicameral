# Local Hotfix Registry (Graphiti Core)

This repository (`bicameral`) maintains intentional local behavioral deviations from upstream `graphiti_core` inside the `patches/` directory.

Because the velocity of upstream `getzep/graphiti` is high, we track explicit patch files rather than relying solely on git rebase/merge history to survive conflict resolution.

## Active hotfixes (Graphiti Core)

### 1) Deterministic Migration Dedupe Mode
- Purpose: Prevent semantic duplicate resolution instability (`invalid duplicate_facts idx`) during bulk backfill by disabling semantic (LLM-based) re-evaluation for exact node matches.
- Files: `graphiti_core/graphiti.py`
- Rationale: Mandatory for Gate 3 reliable curation loading; migration-only parameter thread.

### 2) Malformed `RELATES_TO` Edge Guarding
- Purpose: Prevent `ValidationError` hydration failures downstream when legacy edges miss `uuid`, `group_id`, or `episodes`.
- Files: `graphiti_core/edges.py`, `graphiti_core/utils/maintenance/edge_operations.py`
- Rationale: Schema divergence existed dynamically in legacy data; defensive fallback required inside the core hydration paths.

### 3) Trust-Aware Retrieval & Ranking Additions
- Purpose: Allow overlay scores/thresholds to boost canonical facts (`ingest_curated_facts` vs LLM extractions).
- Files:
  - `graphiti_core/search/search.py`
  - `graphiti_core/search/search_config.py`
  - `graphiti_core/search/search_config_recipes.py`
  - `graphiti_core/search/search_utils.py`
- Rationale: Essential behavior layer for `bicameral` trust topology; cannot be pushed to runtime solely via hooks due to hardcoded score aggregation in `graphiti_core/search`. Will be re-evaluated as upstream search APIs mature.

### 4) Constrained-Soft Extraction Mode
- Purpose: Two-mode extraction architecture for ontology-aware graph lanes.
  - **permissive** (default): existing broad extraction, unchanged.
  - **constrained_soft**: ontology-conformant mode using dedicated prompt branches
    (not appended to permissive prompt — avoids conflicting directives) plus
    code-level enforcement after LLM extraction:
    - `_canonicalize_edge_name()`: snap near-miss relation types to ontology names
      using difflib SequenceMatcher (threshold ≥ 0.78).
    - `_should_filter_constrained_edge()`: drop generic off-ontology edges
      (RELATES_TO, MENTIONS, IS_RELATED_TO, etc.).
- Files:
  - `graphiti_core/prompts/extract_edges.py` — mode-specific prompt dispatch (`_edge_permissive`, `_edge_constrained_soft`)
  - `graphiti_core/prompts/extract_nodes.py` — mode-specific prompt dispatch for all episode types
  - `graphiti_core/utils/maintenance/edge_operations.py` — enforcement helpers + extraction_mode param
  - `graphiti_core/utils/maintenance/node_operations.py` — extraction_mode param thread
  - `graphiti_core/graphiti.py` — extraction_mode param in add_episode + _extract_and_resolve_edges
- Rationale: Permissive extraction creates noise in ontology lanes (RELATES_TO edges, near-miss
  edge names). Code enforcement is more reliable than prompt-only guidance, which is subject to
  LLM drift. Intent guidance comes from per-lane YAML config (intent_guidance / extraction_emphasis).
- Backward compatibility: extraction_mode defaults to 'permissive' at all call sites. No
  existing behavior changed. Permissive lanes are completely unaffected.
- Added to allowlist: `graphiti_core/prompts/extract_edges.py`,
  `graphiti_core/prompts/extract_nodes.py`, `graphiti_core/utils/maintenance/node_operations.py`
- Patches: `patches/graphiti_core/prompts/*.patch`, `patches/graphiti_core/utils/maintenance/*.patch`,
  `patches/graphiti_core/graphiti.py.patch`

## How to Sync Upstream

To safely absorb upstream updates while keeping these hotfixes:

1. **Start Sync Branch:** Create a branch `sync/upstream-YYYYMMDD` from `origin/main`.
2. **Merge Upstream:** `git pull upstream main`
3. **Resolve Conflicts (Upstream Wins in core):** If conflicts arise in `graphiti_core/**`, accept upstream's version. You do not manually rebuild the logic during conflict resolution.
4. **Re-Apply Patches:** Run `git apply patches/graphiti_core/*` to neatly apply our explicit hotfixes over the fresh upstream baseline.
5. **Re-Export Patches:** If upstream structural changes occurred (e.g. they moved code blocks around), run `./scripts/export-core-patches.sh` post-validation to update the line numbers in the stored patch files for the next release.
6. **Guard Check:** The CI run will verify no other files in `graphiti_core/**` were modified besides what is listed in `config/graphiti_core_allowlist.txt`.
